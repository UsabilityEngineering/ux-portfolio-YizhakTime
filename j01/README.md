# EZ Aroma Rice Cooker
Yizhak Cohen - 10/9/23 

I come from a Hispanic family where food is a large part of my culture, especially rice. I often make rice in a pot, which requires careful preparation, attention, and technique. Although I gained more experience in cooking, rice is always a sore spot for me since I am not consistent when making it. Occasionally, I add too much water, leaving the rice mushy. Sometimes, I forget to check the rice, making it cook longer when it turns to mush. Lastly, sometimes I forgot to add more butter, making the rice stick to the bottom of the pan. The pan is an example of **natural mapping**, where there is a clear relationship between the controls and its functions. With a pan, you just need to turn on the burner and place your cooking spray and rice into the pot, you need a certain degree of finesse to make rice correctly. The downside is that the most common mistakes are often irreversible, you cannot unburn rice or “un-mush” mushy rice. 

But, since moving in with my roommate, I noticed he brought his rice cooker which he allowed me to use. I was skeptical at first because I am accustomed to making rice in a pot, however, one day, I decided to try it out. I noticed that the cooker came with a bowl that has measurements on the side, measured in milliliters that are divided into 4 separate sections. The cooker had an interface with a list of buttons for white rice, brown rice, warm and a power button. All I had to do was plug into the outlet and press any of the buttons.

From layout (the buttons) was **learnable** and had a meaning behind it (*purpose*). Not all the rice is the same, so whenever I wanted white rice, I could just press the white rice button. Beforehand, I washed my rice thoroughly and added the rice to the bowl and added exactly 2 cups of water to the bowl. Then, I placed the bowl onto the cooker and I pressed the power button and pressed the white rice option and around 15 to 20 minutes, my rice was done. What amazed me was that after I cooked my tikki masala, and made mango juice, I did not have to check up on the rice cooker at all. My rice came slightly short of perfect, it had a nice fragrance and aromatic smell and the texture was silky and smooth. 

From this experience, I can say this rice cooker matched my **mental model** of what I expected since the cooker looks like a pot and pots can be used to steam food.
