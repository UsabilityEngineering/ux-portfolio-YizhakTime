# My experience with wells fargo mobile 
Yizhak Cohen - 12/2/23

I frequently use the Wells Fargo mobile app to check my bank statements, transfer money, check my balance, or receive direct deposits. It has always been convenient for me as I can find my information on the go, and I do not need to travel to the bank to find my routing number, for example.
